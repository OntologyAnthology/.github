Ontology Anthology is a public collection of ontologies used for describing entities, objects and data. All the ontologies housed in this organization are open source and located in separate repositories to avoid licensing conflicts.

The objective of this collection is to provide easy, reliable access to applications (such as APIs) that make use of RDF language specifications.
